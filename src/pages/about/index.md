### Excellence in drinking - Izcilība dzeršanā

It is not enough simply to drink. One must excel. If you want to succeed as a student at our institution, you must be able to drink (alcoholic or soft drinks) with enthusiasm, excitement and spirit.

### Quality not quantity

Our school is small. We don't want to churn through as many students as we can, that's why we currently only have 1 student, and 8 teachers.

### Student(s) first

As with any other school, our student comes first. The only difference is that at our school, it's because our student just doesn't last that long in bed.

### Direct sourcing

We headhunt our students from millions around the world. We were hoping to recruit one or two more from a trip to Latvia... Bristol works too though.
