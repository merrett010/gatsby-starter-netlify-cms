As you all know we've all worked very hard this year with all of our teachers & students working from home as best as they can and it's finally time to get back to our enriching school trips.

This school trip is particularly special. One of our SSSC students Ben is due to be getting married this year, as I'm sure you've seen on our website. 

The most important details you need to remember, for now, are:

* Arrive in Bristol between 11am-12pm on Saturday 24th July 2021 (We will be checking attendance before leaving the city centre at 1pm)
* Bring a change of clothes that can get messy for one of our Saturday activities
* Sporty activity on Sunday so bring an extra t-shirt incase you get sweaty!
* We will have to check-in to our accommodation **after** some activities on Saturday, so don't pack too heavy!
* You will be representing the school on this trip, so both students and teachers will be expected to be on their best behaviour and dressed correctly at all times, especially Ben

> Lastly: Please endeavour to take a lateral flow COVID test *on Friday, or Saturday morning before you travel*. We will still have to be conscious of COVID on this trip, and will not be going to any "After School Discos"
