## Wet, Warm & Wild

Given the forecast of thunderstorms, rain and warm temperatures, **staff and students are advised to bring light raincoats to keep dry**.

This will also impact our choice of venues; outdoor drinking and dining will likely be unavailable. We will have to evaluate each pub/bar as we go depending how busy/COVID-y they are.

There's **plenty** of bars/pubs on our list though so we're bound to find one!
